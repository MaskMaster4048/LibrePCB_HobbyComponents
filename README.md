# Hobby Components

## Description

This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) library!
Any time I find something missing from LIBRECAD, I'll add it here.
The idea is that anyone who is just starting electronics can see this and
hopefully make good use out of it. Right now, it's just transistors but eventually
I will add things such as THT chips like the common 555 timer.
